Pretty standard setup. Main Title Screen with game title with start button and instructions options. Next screen has the Game screen with controls and concept

## OBSTACLES

So I faced alot of challenges during the course of this game. I was able to get the base down with the keys and how you play but I could not get my music to work. Tried multiple different functions and solutions between saving the mp3 and going to the URL directly.


Hard coded my rhythms but they did not scroll down like they were supposed to.

Had an Title screen but could not connect it to the game properly

Final Results looks like so:

##Code Examples

Some ways I went about styling the game was through creating multiple classes and added shading, colors and gradident to the keys as they were pressed:

I also have some of my JS that I used to have the buttons function to connect to those rhythms.
